# AboutMe

This repository contains a small website project created during my time at the university. The website serves as an introduction to who I am and provides some information about myself. You can access the website by clicking [here](https://buldosik.github.io/AboutMe/).

## Features

One of the notable features of this website project is a Hangman game. Challenge yourself and test your word-guessing skills in an interactive and entertaining way.

Feel free to explore the website and learn more about me!

Note: The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.
