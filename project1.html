            <h2>Bank-Bang</h2>
            <p> That project was started in 2019.
                Bank-Bang was planned as copy of Jetpack Joyride, but with own plot and features. The main idea was that alien try to rob banks.
                However, it was abandoned after a few weeks of development, as there were disagreements in the team.
